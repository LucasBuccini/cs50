    # Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
    #### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/sfXnAOukPEg
    #### Description: My problem is based arround the very known travlling salesman problem, which asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?".
    To solve this problem I've made a python code that input the user the amount of cities that he is going to visit, and create two lists, one list of cities asking for the input of the name of each, and the other one called final_route that is going to give the shortest route possible in order. The code is going to consider the first city entered as the origin point, and after that itt is going to calculate the distances between each point and the current position, converting the names of the cities in [latitude,longitude], and replacing in the list of cities the name of the city wich matches the shortest distance as "Visited", this way the code will not compare the distance to this city animore. After every single loop the final distance is going to add the minor distance for each point, and the final_route list is going to be filled with the next city to be visited, using an assistent that represents the position of the city in the list of final_route (called aux_route).
    In the end the code will print on the terminal the final_route and the distance cursed in kilometers.
